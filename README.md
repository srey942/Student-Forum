# Student Forum
The main purpose of this web application is to create a **tailor-made forum for students**. With a plethora of online forums, there doesn't exist a customized forum for students. Recognizing the importance of the educational forum, the intention is to create a forum that facilitates interactions and learnings outside the classroom.

  Application is live at [Frontend](https://localhost:8080/home) and [Web Service](https://forum-webservice.herokuapp.com/).

## What are the framework & libraries used ?
This application is built using the following frameworks and libraries :package:.
* [Angular 7](https://angular.io/) - Web application framework
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)  - CSS Framework
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Web Fonts Library
* [HTML and CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)- Web designing Language
* [Sails JS](https://sailsjs.com/) - MVC Framework to build Web Services.
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - NoSQL Database used for data storage.


## What are the prerequisite required ?
 * Node JS - [Install](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
 * Angular 7 - [Install](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local)

## How to run the application ?

6. Navigate to front workspace using `cd Backend\app`
7. Run the server by using `sails lift`
8. Now the server will be up in following URL [localhost:1337](http:\\localhost:1337).

**Note** The above steps will succeed only if the prerequisite platforms are installed in your local machine.

## What you can expect to see in here ?
The following are the pages that I've developed as the part of the student forum application

1. [Login](http://localhost:4200/login) - This page allows the user (both professor & student) to sign into the application. Session Management is done by maintaining  'sid' between client and server.
2. [Signup](http://localhost:4200/signup) - This page allows the user to signup for the application. Once the user has signed-in, he/she will be logged in and the session will also be created simultaneously.
3. [Reset](http://localhost:4200/reset) - This page allow the user to reset the password if they've forgotten the password.
4. Logout - An option to logout and reset the user session.
5. [add Post](http://localhost:4200/add) - This page allows the user to create a new post for a particular subject.
6. [discussion list](http://localhost:4200/discussions) - This page list the discussions of the subject the user is registered to. It allows the user to give different types of filter (discussion of particular course, active discussion, archived discussion, etc)
7. [Comments] This feature allows users to view comments
8. [Create comments] This feature allows users to create comments.
9. [Add Course](http://localhost:4200/course/add) - This page, allows the users to add the courses for having discussions. Initially, the user will fill in the add course form on this page and then the course will be added. After adding the course, the course along with its details will be stored in the database.
10. [Browse Course](http://localhost:4200/course/browse) - This page will render the courses stored in the database. The user can search and get enrolled into courses on this page.
